# SoundEffects

A digital sound processing program with multiple use case possibilities:
- reading nad writing .wav or .raw files
- adding an envelope to a sound file
- adding reverb effect to a sound file by simulating a circuit
- creating an echo effect
- merging two or more files
- synthesizing sounds with a few of basic sound wave forms

In future:
- more basic sound effects
- creating and saving your own sound effects based on existing circuit elements
- creating additional sound elements by using runtime compilation
- creating sound wave functions in runtime
